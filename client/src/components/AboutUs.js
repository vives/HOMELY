        We believe that for small jobs around the house, homeowners would prefer
        to <br />
        instantly book a great pro at a pre-determined rate, rather than scour
        dozens of <br />
        reviews, obtain multiple quotes and schedule around a specific company's
        availability.
        <br /> Our goal is to create a marketplace where both homeowners and
        home service <br /> professionals benefit tremendously.
        <br />
        <br />
        For homeowners, our platform provides a seamless booking experience,
        easy-to-
        <br />
        understand pricing, responsive customer service and an additional
        guarantee on all
        <br /> work. <br />
        <br />
        For home service professionals, Homely sends firm jobs and takes care of
        payment,
        <br /> invoicing, and customer service.
